# Simple Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition

## Overview

Setup for testing Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and operator/controller.

The operator/CRD are for an object called "ElectricTrees".  Why?  Well,
my daughter loves the song [Together in Electric Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_in_Electric_Dreams) but she thinks the line is 
"Together in Electric Trees" hence the name of this operator.
